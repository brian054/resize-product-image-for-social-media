import os

# For the custom import I need to rename all the OG images
# the same, so extracting all those names for easy copy and paste

# WAIT HOLLUP
# they're all jpegs instead of pngs so why not just store the 2 images
# in the same folder, then instead of manually renaming all of them you can just
# run a quick script to rename everything based on the .png name. Awesome 

# Use this script to rename all the new jpegs with the png names before removing
# the pngs and then convert all the images to png (99.9% sure resizing code already doing this for us)
